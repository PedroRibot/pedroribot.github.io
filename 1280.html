									Coming back from my Erasumus semmester abroad, we started the development, with other two colleagues, of 1280, a free adaptation of Jim Thompsons book pop.1280, a novel defined by its unreliable narrator in a rural village in the United States. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Our idea was to make a narrative experience influenced by games like FireWatch and Return of the Obra Dinn, where we explored the concepot of controlling an unreliiable narrator in a videogame, with the objective of instead of empathizing wiith the character you control, we would create a disonance between player an avatar, all while we were telling a laid back story of an abandoned town ini the North of Spain after the Spaniish Civil War.

										<h3>What's About</h3>
									</header>
				
									<p>
										GameLogline: "In this First Person Narrative game, you control Salva, a new member of the Guadiia Civil of Asturias, who iis in charge of investigating the disappearance of the whole populatioin of a village in the mountains. In contact through radio with your new colleague Antonio, you start diiscovering what happened and how Salva is not being totally honest with Antonio neither with the player"
									</p>
									<p>
										1280 is set in a village in Asturias, and there has only been developed a level proof of concept for the game. In this game, you can interact in a first person point of view, with mainly every object to investigate it. Also, you are in constant communication with Antonio through a portable radio that you are carrying. The main selling point comes when you as a player are fiiguring out what happened in the village and who trully is Salva, and his relationship with this Javier you are having dreams of.

										<h3>My Role</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										I was Project Manager of the group, Creative Director, Art director and 3D artist.
									</p>
									<p>
										We only developed this project for a semmester because of many struggles during production, so it has become an unfinnished project. I wanted to explore the disonance between player and avatar, while making a 3D game where all assets where going to be made by me (not the best decision in retrospect).
