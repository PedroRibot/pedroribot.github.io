Since it was a short period of time, we explored three branches of technology where Zelia and me had crossed paths. AI autogenerated art and its applications in digital environments, VR in dancing while absent of the space and body you have and not 1 to 1 relation between real and digital bodies. <br><br> This led to two short digital videos and the posterior creation of Zelia of TechDaLab where I joined as Creative Technologist to explore AI and its implications in movement.",

The interesting things developed where: a movement responsive system where each limb would be tracked its acceleration, velocity and jerk, and from any digital object could be responsive by color, size or any other representation, and a system where all I could subtract and add any part of the body to any joint and  get a deformation of the human body so I could attach any limb to any place and give any limb and interchange torsions between them. <br> <br><iframe width='100%' height='500' src='https://player.vimeo.com/video/798306123?h=30e8a53d74&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479' title='Expansive Body and Environment - Zelia ZZ Tan & Pedro Núñez RIbot' frameborder='0' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share' allowfullscreen></iframe> <iframe width='100%' height='500' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/mhSKHKbCnWQ' title='Mirrored Body BTS - Zelia ZZ Tan & Pedro Núñez Ribot' frameborder='0' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share' allowfullscreen></iframe>",

Since this project steps away from what the company is known as the live performances and dives into recorded animations. I was responsible for all the process that goes from raw animation to clean and ready to implement retargeted animation. This process conveys the use of the motion capture software (Qualisys in this case) and Motion Builder.

Since there were a lot of changes though the whole process I ended up creating a custom 3D block out models where I could have the most modularity possible. The two biggest challenges were combining the need of open spaces for the VR user experience but all inside the motion capture grid and space, so the integration process was the smoothest. Also, at a lot of points where there was a block out interesting, I was needed to bring intention and visual proximity to the end result. <br><br>  <iframe width='100%' height='500' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/29crIFvad4Q' title='Tools created for Virtual Crossings Geneva - Cie Gilles Jobin - Pedro Nñuéz Ribot' frameborder='0' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share' allowfullscreen></iframe> <br><br>Lastly I was also the<b> Game and Virtual Production Developer </b> where I had to design and create a quick and easy tool to bridge what the company is used to doing (live performances) to what the project needed.
