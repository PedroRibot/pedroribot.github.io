The two biggest challenges were combining the need of open spaces for the VR user experience but all inside the motion capture grid and space, so the integration process was the smoothest. Also, at a lot of points where there was a block out interesting, I was needed to bring intention and visual proximity to the end result. <br><br>  <iframe width='100%' height='500' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/29crIFvad4Q' title='Tools created for Virtual Crossings Geneva - Cie Gilles Jobin - Pedro Nñuéz Ribot' frameborder='0' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share' allowfullscreen></iframe> <br><br>Lastly I was also the<b> Game and Virtual Production Developer </b> where I had to design and create a quick and easy tool to bridge what the company is used to doing (live performances) to what the project needed.
