									During my Erasumus semmester in <a href="https://ag.mediencampus.h-da.de/"> Hochschule Darmstadt </a> (Germany), together with two students from that grade we worked on the semmester project that had to explore the topic "Memory".
								</p>
								<p>
									We ended up developing, thanks to the support of the coaches and the infrastructure that the university provided, a Social Deduction game that is influenced by games like Werewolf and Secret Hitler. The catch and main selling point of our game was to bring this type of games to a virtual enviroment without interfering in the social physical interactions of the players, something we could achieve thanks to the development of Augmented Reality and the accesibiliity of the smartphone.

										<h3>What's About</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										<a href="https://thephilipcal.itch.io/wwsd"> Itch.io page </a>
									</p>
									<p>
										GameLogline: "In this social deduction AR game one of the witches has been possessed by Satan and now the whole witch circle has to work together to exorcise them but Satanists have infiltrated the ritual turning it into a game of mistrust and deduction."
									</p>
									<p>
										What Would Satan Do? Is a mobile, multiplayer, augmented reality game that aims to
expand the social deduction genre of games, introducing it to a digital environment, with
the intention to not break the real-life presence or interactions between the group.
As the game starts roles have been assigned to the players, dividing them between two
parties with different intentions. Witches have no extra information, being one of them
possessed, their goal is to find and exorcise that witch within the three-moon cycle (nine
moon phases). Satanist, on the other hand, know every person’s role, so they can mess
with the ritual with the objective of being elected three times as an oracle or misusing the
limited three exorcism chances.
Every moon phase, players have to lay the trust on other players till the end of the round,
when the player with the highest amount of trust is elected as oracle and has the chance
to use between two abilities, vision spell, that looks into other players role or exorcism
that exorcises other player. Once one of the abilities has been used, the game progresses
to the next moon phase with new information gained by one player that can decide to
keep it by himself or share it with the others.

										<h3>My Role</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										I was Project Manager of the group, Augmented Reality developer and 3D artist and implementation. 
									</p>
									<p>
										In this university roles were pretty defined and there was a clearer structure for the production of a videogame. I needed an adaptaton phase in order to meet my teammates and work methodology. This project was made in the span of one semmester and it needed day by day producton and work by the three members. We worked closed together and had inifluence in all parts of production.
