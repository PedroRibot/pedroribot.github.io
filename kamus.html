									For my final university project, together with one other friend, we decided to develop a classic 2D platformer, inifluenced by the new wave of Celeste and Ori and the Blind forest gameplay, where our main selling poiint was that, in order to complete the platformnig puzzles, you not only need to control your character, but also needd to control and throw a god essence that bounces throught the scenery.
								</p>
								<p>
									The idea was to bring a new way of platforming to a classic genre, aswell as making an accesible but demanding game altogether. Everythiing s sorrounded by an subsaharian aesthetic influenced by the Dogon people, but in a made up story inivolviing fictional gods in order to not bad represent the culture we are basinig our game about.

										GameLogline: "Kamu's heart has spliitted into many pieces since he decided to leave his loved one to protect our people. As his dying wish, he commands you, to go and rebuilt his heart to gift it to the goddess"
									</p>
									<p>
										Kamus's Offering is a 2D platforming game that aims to create a variant in the platforming genre, by introdducing a core mechanic of throwing and recovering a essence that acts like a ball and bounces throught the scenery. During the 12 main levels ditributed in 3 worlds, new platforming abilities as new level mechanics would be developing the core platforming gameplay in order to make it feel innovative and challenging.
